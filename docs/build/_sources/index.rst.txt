MMfem documentation
===================

Welcome to **MMfem**, a Python package for modeling and solving the Navier-Stokes problem using finite elements. 
This package is focused on academic research and reproducible numerical experimentation.

MMfem is based on `NGSolve <https://ngsolve.org>`_, prioritizing clarity, extensibility, and mathematical transparency over black-box solvers.

The package is intended for: 

- research in numerical analysis and scientific computing 
- prototyping finite element methods 
- teaching and academic experimentation


----

Installation
------------

MMfem is developed as a standard Python package using the ``src`` layout.
The recommended installation method is an **editable install**.

**Requirements**

- Python ≥ 3.9
- NGSolve (installed via conda)
- NumPy

**Using conda (recommended)**

First, activate your conda environment where NGSolve is installed:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda activate base

(or any environment where ``ngsolve`` is available)

Then, from the root of the repository:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install -e .

This allows you to modify the source code without reinstalling the package.

**Verify installation**

You can verify the installation by running:

.. code-block:: bash

   python -c "import mmfem; print(mmfem.__version__)"

----

Getting started
---------------

A simple example to generate a rectangular mesh:

.. code-block:: python

   from mmfem.mesh import rectangle_mesh

   mesh = rectangle_mesh(
       x_min=0.0,
       x_max=1.0,
       y_min=0.0,
       y_max=1.0,
       h=0.1
   )
